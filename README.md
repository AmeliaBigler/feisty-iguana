## Description

This random password generator can be used to create a secure password based on user selected criteria.

The objective of this project was to use JavaScript to generate a unique password based on user input.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This app can be used to generate a secure password based on user input. Users are prompted to select password character length, character case, and inclusion of numbers and/or special characters. Then a password meeting those specifications will be generated and displayed.
A minimum of two character types will be included, ensuring a more secure password than just one character type.
